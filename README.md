## Code style divergences
None I'm aware of.  I tried but I may have missed something.

## Notes for instructor
+ I know I am being inconsistent by using a radio button for distanceUnit
and a drop down for volumeUnit but we needed to use 3 unique inputs for
this project.
+ In a few cases my lines of code wrap with over 80 characters
+ My laptop died on Sunday so I had to get a new laptop and reinstall 
the software so I couldn't spend as much time on this as I had hoped.
+ Just had to reset my password per you permission denied public keys 
won't get to commenting all my code tonight but I will do it.
